# Introduction

Salaam!

Muslims who are coming from India can associate with each other better, given our unique situations and problems, this group is for that purpose.

Also, we may want to help each other with carrying any important document etc to and from India, if required

# Code of Conduct
Please refrain from talking on religious implementation and rituals publicly on this forum - so, let's not discuss about how each of us prays, ways to worship/pray etc.;
Let's stick to talking about the social aspect of our religion - helping each other, stick around, pull each other up (instead of pulling down), look out for each other here in Canada, while making way for other Muslims in India to have a better life and opportunity.

Our group already takes care of this, and it's good to see us being mature at this, but let's also note that this group will not discuss about any sects of Muslims whatsoever. You could be following any sects, we don't care, as long as you identify honestly as an Indian Muslim, you belong here and are welcomed here.

We all have seen what sectarian divide has done for us, let's not fall for it again.
