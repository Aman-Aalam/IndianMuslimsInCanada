# Introduction

Salaam!

Muslims who are coming from India can associate with each other better thanks to our unique situations and problems.

Here, we outline the rules thslis group is governed with.

# Code of Conduct and Rules

This group has been a great resource for many of us, and I am really happy how many of us have found our flock away from our homes.

Since we're sizeable now, I'd like to lay out what we are here for, and what purposes this group serves the best.

### Objective of the group
This group was made so that new and old Indian immigrants to Canada of Muslim faith can connect with each other, be the personal and emotional support, and help each other becoming successful in Canada.

Keeping that objective in mind, please be mindful of the following guidelines, when it comes to posts:

 1. **Relevance:** Be judicial about what you post. Does it help the above objective, does it advance it? If yes, great. If no, re-consider posting.

 2. **Jokes:** Always welcome, but please never be racist, sexist, misogynistic, or caste-ist through jokes, and don't go overboard with them.

 3. **Forwards:** Since it often requires, ALWAYS include your message with the forwards, so that we know why you're forwarding that message here. I am sure none of us randomly forward messages here like our Whatsapp Uncles, so just do a little more and explain in your words what the forward is about.

 4. **Religious Posts:** Please keep it to minimum. We have tonnes of other groups to discuss that, and here, all of us are adults, having our own sources of religious knowledge, and we're here for the above said objective.

 5. **Inclusion:** This group does not discriminate or differentiate based on gender, race, caste, mazhab/fiqh etc. So Shia, Sunni, Devbandi, Barelvi, Bohra, Ismaili, Ahmedi, North Indian, South Indian, Eastern, Western and whatever - you are welcome here. Please don't make any comment about such differentiation.
Its a lot easier to have your messages be misconstrued when interacting over text. Lets be aware that some things can create misunderstandings unintentionally, and try to be mature about it.  
We all have seen what sectarian divide has done for us, let's not fall for it again.

 6. **Adverts:** Feel free to post adverts of services you run or your friends run, or the ones you found online; BUT always post verified information and don't do blind forwards please. Please do your bit in making sure none of us fall for a scam.

 7. **Trigger Warnings:** If the content you're about to post contains violence, blood, gore, extreme graphics, language or anything that can trigger anxiety or extreme emotions in someone, please ALWAYS put a caption BEFORE the content, which says "Trigger Warning: Strong language" etc. So that anybody who wants to avoid reading/watching it, can do so.

 8. **Spam:** Post anything that passes the above criterion, but just don't overdo it.

 9. **Xenophobia and Fundamentalism:** Please don't post anything which is xenophobic, anti-semitic, racist, anti-white, talks about supremacy of any kind, or is categorized as fundamentalism.

 10. **Language of use in the group:** We have people from all over India. Some understand urdu/hindi and some don't. So lets please try to stick to English as much as possible so that most people can understand what's being talked about. Once a while switching to our native languages is okay, and we encourage using non-hindi non-english languages too, but please provide translation wherever possible, so that we all learn about each other's culture too.

We'll update these rules if required, but just be respectful, caring, and friendly with each other.
